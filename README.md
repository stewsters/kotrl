# Kotrl

This is an experiment to port https://github.com/julianmaster/AsciiTerminal to kotlin.  If you want
to try to use it, I recommend starting from his library and converting it, as he has fixed bugs since
I wrote this.

My main reason to do this is to see if I like it better for casual programming than Groovy.
It't really hard to tell how you like a language from cherry picked examples.
